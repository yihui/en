## Professional Experience

I'm currently a software engineer at RStudio, Inc.

### Internship

1. Summer 2012, [AT&T Labs Research](http://research.att.com), Florham, NJ (mentor: [Simon Urbanek](http://urbanek.info))
1. Summer 2013, [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) (mentor: [Raphael Gottardo](http://www.rglab.org))

### Website Management

Sept 2003 - Present

I created and maintained web pages for:

- [The School of Statistics](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn), Renmin University of China (Sept 2003 - Jun 2009)
- [The Center for Applied Statistics](http://www.applstats.org), Renmin University of China (Apr 2004 - Jun 2009)
- The Center for Risk Management and Actuarial Studies (Jun 2004 - Apr 2006); Data Mining Center of Renmin University of China (Jul 2004 - Apr 2006), etc
- The "Great Expectation Society", a student society in Renmin University (Mar 2005 - Jul 2006)

I founded and have been maintaining:

- "[Capital of Statistics](http://cos.name)", a popular online community for statistics in China (May 2006 - Present)

I worked in these web studios:

- The English web studio of Renmin University of China (for the construction of English website of the university) (Sept 2006 - Jun 2009)
- The web club of the School of Statistics (as the founder & leader) (Apr 2006 - 2008)

My personal projects:

- AniWiki: Animations in Statistics (<http://animation.yihui.name/>)
- knitr: Elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation with R (<http://yihui.name/knitr>)

### Conference Organization

Feb 2005 - Present

I initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and organized

- the 1st Chinese R [conference](http://cos.name/2008/12/1st-chinese-r-conference-summary/) (in Beijing), Dec 13~14, 2008

I helped organize these conferences:

- the 3rd Chinese R [conference](http://cos.name/chinar/chinar-2010/) (Beijing), Jun 12~13, 2010
- the 2nd Chinese R [conference](http://cos.name/chinar/chinar-2009/) (Beijing & Shanghai), December 2009
- Second [Conference](http://www.merit.unu.edu/MEIDE/) on Micro Evidence on Innovation in Developing Economies, April 22 ~ 23, 2008 (an international conference; I was also the Chair for the last session on April 22)
- the 2nd [Conference](http://www.applstats.org/english/io/index.htm) on Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA): Econometric Modeling and Policy in Trade, Investment and Economic Integration, April 17th ~ 18th, 2006
- the 15th International [Conference](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/21940.html) on Input-Output Techniques, June 27th ~ July 1st, 2005
- the Data Mining and Business Intelligence Conference 2006
- the International Statistics [Forum](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/22120.html) 2006

### Statistical Consulting

May 2005 - Present

I offer statistical consulting by email and I have been answering questions in the [Capital of Statistics](http://cos.name/cn/) almost every day. I'm particularly interested in these topics:

- data analysis and visualization
- theoretical problems without measure theory
- linear models, generalized linear models and nonlinear models
- R packages that I maintain (other questions on R should be asked on StackOverflow)
- statistics in other disciplines (e.g. biology) in which I can also learn something from you
- real world data mining and machine learning
- simulation
- teaching

I ignore any questions on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) or factor analysis, as I do not believe their usefulness at all. I know little about time series and do not like econometrics. I have little interest in _quantitative_ research in social science.

### Other Work Experience

Sep 2004 - present

Duties in associations & centers:

- Program chair, Section on Statistical Graphics, American Statistical Association (2015)

## Computer Skills

I like playing with computer tools for building web pages and statistical computation & graphics. I often try to improve the efficiency of my work by creating software tools (i.e. work hard to be lazy).

- Statistical Packages: [R](http://www.r-project.org) (<del>OpenBUGS, S-Plus, SPSS, Eviews, SAS, MatLab, STATA, AMOS and LISREL</del>)
- Languages: R, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL (<del>Visual Basic, VBA, VBScript, ASP, Java, C</del>)
- Applications: LaTeX via [LyX](http://www.lyx.org), Markdown via [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org), databases (e.g. MySQL), <del>SVN and</del> GIT
- Operating Systems: 95% macOS, 2.5% Ubuntu, and 2.5% Windows (the latter two mostly for purposes of testing software)

Listed above are what I'm very familiar with, and the ones being crossed out are due to my brain stack overflow and I do garbage collection in my brain once in a while.

## Software Packages

I support open source software, and below is a list of open source packages that I'm involved with.
